- remember Project Structure -> Modules -> Dependencies, 
  and there you can see libs included to the module. 
  You should also see a checkbox near each lib in column 'Export'.
  if you didn't import, you should goto gosu lib to import
  "gosu-core-1.14.2.jar" and "gosu-core-api-1.14.2.jar" and "gw-asm-all-5.0.4.jar".
